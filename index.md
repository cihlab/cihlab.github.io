# Welcome to CiH @ FDU ![faet](./assets/img/faetlog.png)

The CiH lab is from [Frontier Institute of Chip and System](https://fics.fudan.edu.cn/) of [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn). It also has a strong collabration with [the State Key lab of ASIC and systems](http://sme.fudan.edu.cn) and [FAET (工研院)](http://faet.fudan.edu.cn/).
Our objective is to develop intelligent hardware, from chips to systems, for emerging applications.
Currently, we target efficient circuits and system designs for smart sensors, intelligent robots and agile AI/analog deployment on VLSI.
A brief chinese introduction can be found via [FAET faculty website](http://faet.fudan.edu.cn/8b/bb/c13533a166843/page.htm).




## News
* _07/01/2021_, we have two paper published on GLSVLSI 2021 (one Chiplet paper and one Computing-in-memory paper), and one paper accpeted by MWSCAS 2021 (machine-learning based ADC characterization).
* _12/12/2020_, we have one AI accelerator paper accepted on ASPDAC 2021 and one ADC paper on TCAS-I. 
* _08/15/2020_, Our paper "An Algorithm-Circuits-Architecture codesign DNN accelerator" is accepted by [IEEE JETCAS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162116).  
* _06/20/2020_, Chixiao recieves Shanghai Rising Star Program (上海启明星计划).

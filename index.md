# Welcome to CiH @ FDU ![faet](./assets/img/faetlog.png)

The CiH lab is from [Frontier Institute of Chip and System（FICS，芯片院）](https://fics.fudan.edu.cn/) of [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn). It also has a strong collabration with [the State Key lab of ASIC and systems](http://sme.fudan.edu.cn) and [FAET (工研院)](http://faet.fudan.edu.cn/).
Our objective is to develop intelligent hardware, from chips to systems, for emerging applications.
Currently, we target efficient circuits and system designs for smart sensors, intelligent robots and agile AI/analog deployment on VLSI.
A brief chinese introduction can be found via [FICS faculty website](https://fics.fudan.edu.cn/ff/d6/c22621a393174/page.htm).




## News
* _10/20/2021_, Our paper "Computing-on-meomry-boundary+Multi-chiplet-module" is accepted by ISSCC 2022 !!!
* _07/01/2021_, we have two paper published on GLSVLSI 2021 (one Chiplet paper and one Computing-in-memory paper), and one paper accpeted by MWSCAS 2021 (machine-learning based ADC characterization).
* _12/12/2020_, we have one AI accelerator paper accepted on ASPDAC 2021 and one ADC paper on TCAS-I.

# Welcome to CiH @ FDU ![faet](./assets/img/faetlog.png)

The CiH lab is from [FAET (工研院)](http://faet.fudan.edu.cn/) of [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn). It also has a strong collabration with [the State Key lab of ASIC and systems](http://sme.fudan.edu.cn).
Our objective is to develop intelligent hardware, from chips to systems, for emerging applications.
Currently, we target efficient circuits and system designs for smart sensors, intelligent robots and agile AI/analog deployment on VLSI.
A brief chinese introduction can be found via [FAET faculty website](http://faet.fudan.edu.cn/8b/bb/c13533a166843/page.htm).




## News
* _02/11/2020_, We open source an unofficial source code ([link here](https://github.com/zhutmost/lsq-net)) on low-bitwidth quantization schemem for DNNs ([LSQ @ ICLR2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08153)). It achieves the same FP32 accurracy on ResNet with 3b activation/weight quantization. (Benchmark: ImageNet)
* _11/12/2019_, Chixiao co-authored paper "XNORAM: A Binary CiM Architecture with Flexbile Data Flow Mappying" is accepted by AICAS 2020.
* _08/18/2019_, Chixiao's proposal: Sensing-Computution-Memory-in-one Circuits and Systems design is approved and sponsored by NSFC (国家自然科学基金-面上项目).

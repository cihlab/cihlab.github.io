# Welcome to CiH @ FDU ![faet](./assets/img/faetlog.png)

The CiH lab is from [FAET (工研院)](http://faet.fudan.edu.cn/) of [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn). It also has a strong collabration with [the State Key lab of ASIC and systems](http://sme.fudan.edu.cn).
Our objective is to develop intelligent hardware, from chips to systems, for emerging applications.
Currently, we target efficient circuits and system designs for smart sensors, intelligent robots and agile AI/analog deployment on VLSI.
A brief chinese introduction can be found via [FAET faculty website](http://faet.fudan.edu.cn/8b/bb/c13533a166843/page.htm).

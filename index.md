# Welcome to CiH-Lab @ FDU !

The CiH lab is from [College of Integrated Circuits and Nano-Micro Electronics（集成电路与微纳电子创新学院）](https://icmne.fudan.edu.cn/) of [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn). It also has a strong collabration with [the State Key lab of Integrated Circuits and Systems](https://sklics.fudan.edu.cn/).
Our objective is to develop intelligent hardware, from chips to systems, for emerging applications.
Currently, we target efficient in-memory and processing circuits and system designs for large scale intelligent computing devices.

## Positions

We are looking for undergrad/master/Ph.D students with background of EE/CS, especially IC design, embedded, computer archiecture and alorightms. 
However, I cannot offer more than 1-2 Ph.Ds per year, which makes it a hard decision. 
As a result, since 2025, I will organize a pre-summer-camp exam after a CV review. Please make sure you are OK with the precedure.

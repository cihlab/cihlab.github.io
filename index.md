# Welcome to CiH @ FDU !

The CiH lab, led by Dr. [Chixiao CHEN](./cxchen.md), is from [Frontier Institute of Chip and System（FICS，芯片院）](https://fics.fudan.edu.cn/) of [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn). It also has a strong collabration with [the State Key lab of Integrated Circuits and Systems](https://sklics.fudan.edu.cn/) and [FAET (工研院)](http://faet.fudan.edu.cn/).
Our objective is to develop intelligent hardware, from chips to systems, for emerging applications.
Currently, we target efficient in-memory and processing circuits and system designs for smart sensors and agile AI/analog deployment on VLSI.
A brief chinese introduction can be found via [FICS faculty website](https://fics.fudan.edu.cn/4c/e6/c22621a412902/page.htm).

## Positions

We are looking for undergrad/master/Ph.D students with background of EE/CS, especially IC design, embedded, computer archiecture and alorightms. 
However, I cannot offer more than 1-2 Ph.Ds per year, which makes it a hard decision. 
As a result, since 2025, I will organize a pre-interview test instead a CV review. Please make sure you are OK with the precedure.

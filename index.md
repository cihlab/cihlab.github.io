# Welcome to CiH @ FDU !

The CiH lab is from [Frontier Institute of Chip and System（FICS，芯片院）](https://fics.fudan.edu.cn/) of [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn). It also has a strong collabration with [the State Key lab of Integrated Circuits and Systems](https://sklics.fudan.edu.cn/) and [FAET (工研院)](http://faet.fudan.edu.cn/).
Our objective is to develop intelligent hardware, from chips to systems, for emerging applications.
Currently, we target efficient in-memory and processing circuits and system designs for smart sensors and agile AI/analog deployment on VLSI.
A brief chinese introduction can be found via [FICS faculty website](https://fics.fudan.edu.cn/4c/e6/c22621a412902/page.htm).

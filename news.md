# Complete List of CiH News

* _02/11/2020_, We open source an unofficial source code on low-bitwidth quantization schemem for DNNs ([LSQ @ ICLR2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08153)). It achieves the same FP32 accurracy on ResNet with 3b activation/weight quantization.(Benchmark: ImageNet) It is via: https://github.com/zhutmost/lsq-net .
